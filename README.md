## Description   
### Introduction

There has been an explosion in current trend of generative model ranging from GPT, VAE, GAN, diffusion model, and their variations. This is our project exploring the variation of diffusion model where you do not need a classifier jointly trained.

#### Goals

The goal of this project is to train a diffusion model with linear noise scheduling and without a classifier guidance. Also, we include a guide on how to play around with our model.

## How to run

First, upload all files and folder into a folder on google drive. Then runs on Google Colab. We will have detailed instruction later. For now, here is the link to our model's weight. You can download it and upload to a newly created folder called "models": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13iYCsLCtw9T9CVS3tAo3WdnHWxzD9YwP?usp=sharing.
